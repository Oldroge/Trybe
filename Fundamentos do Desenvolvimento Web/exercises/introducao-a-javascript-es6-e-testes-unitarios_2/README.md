In this stage we learn some methods to interact with objects. These methods help me when I need some reading from my keys or values, or when I need copy it.
Here we took the first step for advanced JavaScript.

The methods that we saw in this class was:
- Object.keys;
-Object.values;
- Object.entries;
- Object.assign;
