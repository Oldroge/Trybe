// The first step to write tests is to understand the sctructure that want to have and the expected behaviors.

// About the structure:
// The function receives a parameter called "average";
// Answer as "disapproved" or "approved";

// About the expected behaviors:
// 1 - If the value is less than 7 should be "disapproved"; 2 - If passed a value bigger than 7, the answer expected should be "approved"; 3 - What if the value equals 7 the answer should be "approved";
