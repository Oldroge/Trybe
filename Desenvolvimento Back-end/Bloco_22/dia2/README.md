This day we learn about many concepts about database modeling as:
- 1ª normal form: Columns should have fonly one value. Values in one column should be the same data type. Each column should have a single name. The data order registered in a table shouldn't affect the data integrity;
- 2ª normal form: The table should be in the 1ª normal form. The table shouldn't have partial depencies;
- 3ª normal form: Finally, the table should be in the 1ª and 2ª normal forms. The table shouldn't have attributes (columns) that dont be totally dependents in the PK (PRIMARY KEY);

What is a dump and how can create a 'backup' to us with it as in the workbench as in the command prompt.
